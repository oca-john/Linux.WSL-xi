# Computing Environment Building
> Build my own linux environment, there is some records.
## 1. Linux Environment
### Lnx-Change-Boot-Mode.md
- Set text mode as the default mode to enter you opensuse. 
- As openSUSE use the systemd to control it, that is different as the init levels, which confused me such a long time. 
- Just the `systemctl` tool.
- Now, it's ok.

### Lnx-Openbox-Setup
- Docky as dock, Tint2 as the panel, Feh to set wallpaper.

### Lnx-Run-Firefox-in-CML
- Make a shortcut of Firefox, and also for other application, for you can run an application quickly in command line, like konsole. 

### Lnx-Window-Maker-Setup
- Setting the system dock, Define the menu, Control the Color of window.

## 2. Windows Environment
### CMD Default Path & Make your Command
- cmd是windows下对标终端模拟器的工具，继承自自家的Dos，在于windows进行交互时，是一个基础的好用的工具。

### GitBash as your Environment
- GitBash是Git在windows下的命令行模式，但是集成了大量的命令行工具，功能十分强大，且由于工作模式与linux下类似，更加友好。通过配置将GitBash作为默认的Shell将有利于平台的统一操作。
